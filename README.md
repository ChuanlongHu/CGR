This project can be used in conjunction with an existing RDF query engine.

After configuring the query engine's address and the RDF endpoint's address, run this project as a background service and send queries to it.
It will then return a rewritten query. The engine will then execute the rewritten query and perform post-processing to obtain the query results.
